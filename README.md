## Description

View and manage the departments, roles, and employees within a company to help organize and plan a business.

### Below is from last readme but i like the set up of it

I have modified start code to create an application that can be used to write and save notes. I have built the entire back end of this application using Express.js, which includes saving and retrieving note data from a JSON file. I then connected the front end to the back end and deployed it to Heroku.
