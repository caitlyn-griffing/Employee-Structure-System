# Employee Structure System (ESS)

## Description

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). I have built this command-line application from scratch in order to manage a company's database using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
